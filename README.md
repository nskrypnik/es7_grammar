# What is this?

A package containing the ES7 grammar described with [pyparsing](https://pypi.org/project/pyparsing/)notation so you may use it in your projects for ES7 parsing purposes.

A parser using this grammar may not be super fast though, but as for me it's very readable if you want to understand how parser are made and pyparsing notation looks very pythonic and thus very readable. So I believe it may be helpful and useful for its niche. Also there's a likelihood that pyparser and thus this grammar may be successfully compiled using [Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/) project and performance may be increased dramatically in this case.

So don't hesitate to use and contribute.

# Installation

Meanwhile just

```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/nskrypnik/es7_grammar.git
```

Later on I may or may not make a PyPI package.

# Disclaimer

Very likely it doesn't work now. So it's not even in alpha stage but in very early development. So don't use it unless you're contributing to it.
